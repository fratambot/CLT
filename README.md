# Central Limit Theorem

This notebook is inspired by [3Blue1Brown's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo) and it implements, in Python, the simulations showed in the video allowing to use intuition to understand this fundamental theorem of probability theory.

Some remainders on mathematical concepts and definition will be given but you're strongly incouraged to watch the video for a better understanding.

### Usage

You can simply read from GitHub the notebook in the notebook folder `notebook/CLT.ipynb`.

If you want to modify/play with the code you can clone the repository and run the command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

A conda environment called `CLT` will be created and all the necessary packages installed.

Enjoy ! :)
