![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20300069/225655389-5e91d747-69ca-44ed-8498-18690f874fd7.png)

This notebook is inspired by [3Blue1Brown's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo) and it implements, in Python, the simulations shown in the video allowing to use intuition to understand this fundamental theorem of probability theory.

Some reminders on mathematical concepts and definitions will be given but you're strongly incouraged to watch the video for a better understanding.

### Usage

You can simply read the notebook in the notebooks folder `notebooks/CLT.ipynb` directly in GitHub.

If you want to play with the code, you can clone the repository and run the command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

A conda environment called `CLT` will be created and all the necessary packages installed.

Enjoy ! ðŸ¤—
